# Description:

Traning and validating k-nearest neighbors model to predict the disease state (aml vs. healthy) of 613 subjects from gene expression data. KNN-Model is trained using 974 differentially expressed probe sets from 2,761 aml patients and healthy subjects in scikit-learn. Model has 97.93 (+/- 0.03) traning/validation accuracy. The data, code, and supplementary materials can all be found here.
